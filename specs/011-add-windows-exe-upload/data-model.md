# Data Model: Windows 单文件 EXE 编译产物上传

**Feature**: 011-add-windows-exe-upload
**Date**: 2026-01-23

## Overview

This feature is a pure CI/CD configuration change with no data model modifications. No new entities, data structures, or persistence schemas are required.

## No Changes Required

This feature does not involve:
- New data entities
- Modified data structures
- Database schema changes
- API data models
- Frontend/backend data contracts

## Artifacts

The only "data" involved in this feature are the build artifacts generated by the CI/CD pipeline:

### Windows Build Artifacts

**Location**: GitHub Release assets

**Generated Files**:
- `rwr-toolbox_{version}_x64-setup.exe` - NSIS installer (existing)
- `rwr-toolbox_{version}_x64.exe` - Single-file executable (new)

**Properties**:
- File names include version number from `tauri.conf.json`
- Files are uploaded to GitHub Release automatically by `tauri-action`
- No data model changes required to support file naming

## Configuration Data

### GitHub Actions Workflow Configuration

**File**: `.github/workflows/release.yml`

**Modified Section**:
```yaml
- name: Build and publish Tauri app
  uses: tauri-apps/tauri-action@v0
  with:
    # Added --bundles exe parameter for Windows platform
    args: --bundles exe,nsis ${{ matrix.args }}
```

**Note**: This is a workflow configuration change, not a data model change.

## Conclusion

No data model changes are required for this feature. The implementation involves only CI/CD workflow configuration modifications.
