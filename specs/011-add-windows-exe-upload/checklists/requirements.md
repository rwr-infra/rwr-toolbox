- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous

- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED

All validation items have been successfully completed. The specification is ready for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).

**Summary**:
- No implementation details found
- All requirements are testable and unambiguous
- Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- User scenarios cover all primary flows
- Edge cases have been identified
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
